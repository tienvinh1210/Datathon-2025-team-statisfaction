# Executive Summary

**GRB Co.** is experiencing sustained revenue decline due to supply chain inefficiencies. This analysis of 32,000+ hourly logistics records (2021-2024) reveals critical performance gaps and provides actionable solutions for **15-25% cost reduction** and **20-30% delivery improvement**.

### **Main Inefficiencies Identified:**

1.  **🚨 Cost Crisis**: Average shipping cost (\$200+) exceeds target by 33%, with high variability
2.  **⚠️ Risk Overload**: 60%+ operations classified as high-risk, far exceeding 30% target
3.  **📉 Delivery Failure**: 35%+ late deliveries, well below 85% on-time target
4.  **🔧 Equipment Shortages**: 40%+ equipment unavailability causing operational bottlenecks
5.  **👨‍💼 Driver Issues**: 30%+ drivers with poor behavior scores and fatigue concerns
6.  **⏰ Delay Escalation**: Average delays of 4+ hours, significantly impacting customer satisfaction
7.  **📊 Performance Variability**: High cost and delivery time variability indicating unstable operations

**💡 Key Insight**: High-risk operations cost 40%+ more than low-risk operations while delivering 50%+ more delays, creating a massive inefficiency where the highest-cost operations provide the worst service quality.

**💡 Key Insight**: Equipment unavailability has minimal impact on logistics performance in this dataset. Analysis shows only modest cost increases (~$10-15 per operation), small on-time rate decreases (~3-5%), and negligible fuel consumption changes (~1-2%). This suggests that other factors (traffic, weather, route risk) may be more significant drivers of performance variation than equipment availability.

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

**💡 Key Insight**: Driver behavior and fatigue levels directly correlate with delivery performance, with poor behavior scores and high fatigue levels resulting in 2-3x longer delays and 30%+ cost increases, making driver management a critical success factor.
